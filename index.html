                        Throughout history, soldiers was the major part in every military. Training at the age of 18, they fought through hard training and to the point of becoming the strongest men in society. <code><span>But history changed</span> </code>                        as robots was made to combat threats from enemy and not loose the lives of soldiers. But this would backfired upon the many countries as robots soon attack their own creator, resulting in the <code><span>First Mankind War.</span> </code>                        The swarm of multiple robots would overwhelm Europe forcing many to evacuate to the USA and surrounding country. Dimitri Sol, a American Commander of the <code><span>1st Delta Squadron</span> </code> made out of soldiers with experience
                        fighting robots. <code><span>The United Union</span> </code> sent Dimitri and his squad to infiltrate the robots occupation within France to find themself under heavy fire. Dimitri's was pull back from the <code><span>infiltration</span> </code>                        but his squad who was sent ahead was still within Northern France. He had a choice, leave his squad to die, or rescue them. He would made his mind up, in response, the 2nd and 3rd Delta Squadron joined up with him to rescue their
                        fellow men and escape from France. What comes next for Dimitri's and his fellow friends in France?
